Test Failure on expectation:

Failure message:
	basic_string::substr: __pos (which is 3) > this->size() (which is 0)

List of steps that executed successfully:

	Expectation: net bytes assembled = 8
	Expectation: stream_out().buffer_size() returned 8, and stream_out().read(8) returned the string "abcdefgh"
